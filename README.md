### Acknowledgments
This work originated from the spatio-temporal data mining group (the fifth group) of JD urban computing summer camp in 2020, thank Jingyuan Wang for helpful guidance and discussions, these papers are collected and classified by Dayan Pan, Geyuan Wang, Zehua He, Xiaoling Liu, Xiaochen Yang, Xianting Huang and me. We hope it will benefit those researching and interested in spatio-temporal data mining and related areas.
